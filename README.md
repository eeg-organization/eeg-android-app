# ADDvEEG - Automated Depression Detection via EEG Signals

ADDvEEG is a mobile app built using Flutter, designed to automate the process of depression detection using EEG (Electroencephalogram) signals. The app provides an accessible and convenient tool for individuals to assess their mental health status. Patients can take the HAM-D quiz, perform an EEG test, and monitor their progress over time. Doctors can monitor patients, administer the BDI and HAM-D quizzes, and analyze patient data for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, relatives receive notifications when the quiz score exceeds a warning limit, and the EEG device is connected using Bluetooth.
